The code and datasets are meant to be used for a LunchNLearn session, 05/26/2021, where we will discuss NLP Topic Modeling, Graph Machine Learning, 
and Ensemble learning on the Enron emails dataset. Code with the -Colab postscript can be run in Google Colab after uploading appropriate datasets. 

Feel free to run the other code included here in Jupyter Notebook or convert to a .py file to run in other IDEs. 

Any questions, please reach out to disten_olivia@bah.com
